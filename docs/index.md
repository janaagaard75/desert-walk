My grandmother taught me this solitaire card game. I got tired of laying out the cards, so this was a great excuse to learn how to create an app.

The goal of the game is to arrange all the cards in order from aces to kings, moving one card at a time, trying to avoid creating empty spaces behind kings. The cards can only be shuffled three times during a play, making it quite rare that the game is solved.
